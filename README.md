## What is pepinho?

Pepinho is a pet project aiming to improve specific features and usability issues in the Peppi virtual student desktop. Pepinho specifically explores the version of Peppi used at the University of Oulu, but work done here likely useful elsewhere too.

## What is Peppi?

Peppi provides a virtual desktop for university and polytechnic students in Finland. https://www.peppi-konsortio.fi/

## Targets

Two points of interests have been identified for further exploration:

1. /calendar - Personal calendar of the student
   - currently visable only in Tuudo app
   - no export functionality to your personal calendar 
2. /studyguide - Study guide
   - poor usability of current web site: https://opas.peppi.oulu.fi/fi/index?period=2023-2024
   - no possibility to plan studies with lecture, exercise and exam dates in a calendar view

### Actual work

General steps for exploring Peppi:

1. Formulate the problem and the goal of the project
2. Gather and explore data and it's sturcture
3. Inspect API calls
4. Reverse engineer API calls to use Peppi
   - check usage rights
5. UI design and development...


### Collaboration

I welcome anyone battling daily with the horrors of using Peppi to participate in this project.
